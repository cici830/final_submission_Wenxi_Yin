My work is an interactive particle system inspired by ancient Chinese bronzes in museums. The beauty of this ancient artifact inspired me to create a dynamic, interactive work of art. My idea was to reflect the unique texture and shine on the bronzes by simulating the movement of the particles and generating sound effects when struck (mouse clicked).
The player can generate new particles by clicking the mouse, and these particles move across the canvas creating a dynamic, flowing visual effect. Changes in the background image and iterations of particle styles provide an ever-changing visual experience that mimics the sound of striking a bronze object. In addition, the collision of particles with the edges of the canvas and the sound effects created by the particles colliding with each other added interactivity, allowing the user to feel like they were interacting with the artwork.While writing the code my new particle in case1 was not showing up, so I used Chatgpt to find out what the problem was. Chatgpt says to make sure that in the "particle" class the "style" property is set correctly and that the particle is drawn correctly based on the "style" value. is set correctly and that the particles are drawn correctly based on the value of "style". I added some console.log statements to the show() method to check that the value of the style property was correct and to make sure that the particles were drawn correctly, and that solved the problem.
This project is an exploration of the bridge between ancient craftsmanship and modern technology, aiming to reinterpret traditional art forms through the digital medium so that viewers can experience and appreciate the beauty of ancient cultural heritage in a new way. Through this interactive approach, it echoes the dual role of bronze as a witness to history and as an expression of art, while also embodying the fusion of technology and art.
